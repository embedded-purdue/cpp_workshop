## Overview
This hands-on workshop introduces embedded engineers to C++ in the context of bare-metal firmware development. You’ll start from familiar C patterns and incrementally explore how C++ can improve readability, safety, and scalability in low-level environments.

By the end, you’ll:

- Gain an intuition for why C++ can be better than C for embedded code
- Learn (or review) the basics of object-oriented programming
- Leverage C++ in writing a driver, app, and designing a system
- Get ideas on personal projects, interviews, and more!
