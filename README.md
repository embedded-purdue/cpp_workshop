# Embedded C++ Workshop
**Hosted by Embedded Systems @ Purdue (ES@P)**

## Overview
This hands-on workshop introduces embedded engineers to C++ in the context of bare-metal firmware development. You’ll start from familiar C patterns and incrementally explore how C++ can improve readability, safety, and scalability in low-level environments.

By the end, you’ll:

- Understand why and how to use C++ in embedded systems.
- Write idiomatic C++ drivers and application code for a microcontroller.
- See how abstraction, encapsulation, and RAII simplify system design.
- Compare patterns in C vs C++ through real hardware examples.

## Setup
_Please do this before coming to the workshop!_
